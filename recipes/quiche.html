        <H1>Ingredients</H1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pie Crust</strong>:Donâ€™t skimp on flavor and textureâ€“ make homemade pie crust. My favorite pie crust recipe is straightforward and you can make it ahead of time and freeze. One of my best baking tips is to always have pie dough in the freezer!</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Cream and Milk</strong>: For the best tasting quiche, use a combination of whole milk and heavy cream. (Or simply use half-and-half.) Using just heavy cream produces an overly thick filling. Whole milk is great, but a combo of heavy cream and milk is better.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Use 4 eggs per 1 cup of milk. Some quiche recipes throw in an extra egg yolk or two, but I donâ€™t find it necessary with the ratio of ingredients in my recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: I donâ€™t add salt to the filling if Iâ€™m using a salty add-in, such as cheese or ham. However, if you are making a plain quiche I recommend both.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Add-Ins</h2>
        <p>Most quiche add-ins should be pre-cooked and can still be warm when mixing into the egg filling. I recommend patting them dry before using because excess moisture will create a soupy quiche. Spinach, kale, bell pepper, and tomatoes can be fresh, but you can definitely sautÃ© them first if desired.</p>

            <li>goat cheese</li>
            <li>cooked cubed ham</li>
            <li>bacon</li>
            <li>carmelized onions</li>
            <li>sauteed mushrooms</li>
            <li>sauteed chopped asparagus</li>
            <li> chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make pie dough ahead of time, then refrigerate or freeze until youâ€™re ready to make the pie. Pie crust must chill for at least 2 hours before rolling out.</li>
                <li>Roll it out, then fit into your 9-inch pie dish. Crimp or flute the edges.Roll it out, then fit into your 9-inch pie dish. Crimp or flute the edges.</li>
                <li>Fill with pie weights. As the pie dough bakes, its fat will melt. The melting fat causes the pie crust to shrink down the sides of the pie dish. To prevent the pie dough from completely losing its shape, weigh it down with pie weights. Carefully line the pie dough with parchment paper first, then pour in pie weights or even dry beans. (Note: 2 packs of these pie weights is needed!)</li>
                <li>Bake until the edges are lightly brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove pie weights, then prick the crust with a fork.</li>
                <li>Bake crust for about 8 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Fill with quiche filling, then bake the quiche.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Tips and Tricks</h3>
            <p>Now that youâ€™re fully prepped with all this quiche info, letâ€™s bake! Here are 3 new quiche recipes for you and each are pictured above. Follow the quiche baking instructions in the recipe below. Leave out the added 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk these add-ins into the egg/cream mixture in step 4. After baking the quiche, top with a sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese or any cheese used in the filling. Feel free to add a small handful of fresh herbs such as chopped parsley, dill, or basil. I served each of these with homemade hollandaise sauce and definitely didnâ€™t regret it. ðŸ™‚</p>
